# Debugging TypeScript in VS Code Without Compiling (using `ts-node`)

This repo contains a sample TypeScript project with a Visual Studio Code `launch.json` that

It has been tested with **Node 8.4** and **VS Code 1.16** (the latest at time of writing!),
your mileage with other versions may vary! :)

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/EnterpriseJSTutorial/vscode-ts-node-debugging.git
npm install
```

## VS Code Debug Tasks

This repo contains the following VS Code Debug tasks (accessible via the debug button on the left):

**Current TS File** - allows you to debug the currently open TypeScript file. Try it with `src/index.ts`:

These tasks should allow you to hit breakpoints in your code, without needing to compile first.
